preferences. What type of website would you recommend, and what technologies might you
use?
 2. Dynamic website using Javascript and Databases

Question 2
Which of the following is a characteristic of a static website?
 1. Displays the same content for all users

Question 3
What is an example of a dynamic website?
 4. A social media platform like facebook

Question 4
Which technology is essential for creating a dynamic website that interacts with a database?
 4. Python

 Scenario 5 -Client-server architecture

Question 1
You are explaining the client-server model to a new team member. Describe a scenario where
the client-server architecture is used, and explain the roles of the client and server.
 2. Client requests data, server processes and responds with data
The scenario painted here is an Online Shopping Website
Imagine you are visiting an online shopping website, like Amazon. This website uses the client-server architecture to provide its services.

Role of client: The client is any device or application that requests services or resources from the server. In this scenario, your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) acts as the client. Initiates requests, displays data, user interactions.
Role of server: The server is a powerful computer or set of computers that provide services or resources to clients. In this scenario, the server is responsible for hosting the online shopping website and managing the backend processes.Handles requests, processes data, sends responses, manages user sessions.

Question 2
In a typical web application, what is the role of the server?
 1. To provide data and services requested by the client

Question 3
Which component of the client-server architecture is responsible for storing and retrieving
information from databases?
 2. Server

Question 4
Which component of the client-server architecture is responsible for storing and retrieving
information from databases?
 3. Any device connected to a network

 Scenario 6 -Web brower functionality

Question 1
You are optimizing a web application for better performance. What role does the web browser
play in rendering a web page, and what steps are involved from entering a URL to displaying
the content?
 3. Fetches resources, processes responses, and renders content. (URL entry, DNS resolution, TCP/IP connection, HTTP request, Server processing, HPPT response, Rendering the content, Displaying the content)

Question 2
What is the first step a web browser takes when you start typing a URL?
4. Performs a DNS lookup.

Question 3
How does a browser determine the IP address of a URL?
2. By performing a DNS lookup.

Question 4
What happens after the browser receives the HTTP response from the server?
 1. The browser processes and renders the content.

Scenario 7 -HTTP request handling

Question 1
Your web application is experiencing slow response times. What could be a potential cause
related to HTTP request handling, and how can it be resolved?
3. Optimize the size of HTTP responses.

Question 2
In optimizing HTTP requests, what is a good practice to reduce load times?
2. Reducing the size of HTTP responses.

 Question 3
If a web page is taking too long to load due to multiple HTTP requests, what technique can be
used to improve performance?
1. Minimizing HTTP requests by combining files.

Question 4
How can HTTP response caching help in improving the performance of a web application?
2. By storing copies of frequently accessed resoures

Scenario 8 -Evolution of HTML

Question 1
You are tasked with updating an old website that uses HTML 2.0. How has HTML evolved,
and what are some key features in the latest version that you can use to enhance the website?
1. Support for CSS and JavaScript. New semantic elements and multimedia support.

Question 2
What is the primary use of HTML in web development?
3. To structure web page content

Question 3
Which of the following versions of HTML introduced new semantic elements like <header>,
<footer>, and <article>?

What is the role of CSS when used alongside HTML?
 4. To control the layout, style, and appearance of web pages

Scenario 9 -Front-end frameworks

Question 1
Your team needs to choose a front-end framework for a new project focused on creating
dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Which framework would you recommend, and why?
 2. React.js - React's component-based architecture allows for reusable, modular components, which can make development and maintenance easier.

Question 2
Which of the following frameworks is most commonly used for building responsive web
designs?
 1. Bootstrap

Question 3
In the context of front-end development, which library would you use to simplify DOM
manipulation?
 3. Jquery

Question 4
For a project requiring a lot of real-time updates to the user interface, which front-end
framework would you recommend?
 1. React.js

Scenario 10 -Browser cache

Question 1
You notice that a frequently visited web page is loading slowly. How can browser caching
improve the performance, and what is the process involved?
 2. Storing copies of frequently accessed resources locally.

Question 2
What is a benefit of caching HTTP responses in the browser?
 1. Reduces server load and speeds up page load times.

Question 3
When implementing caching strategies, which HTTP header is used to specify caching
directives?
 2. Cache-Control

Question 4
Which of the following scenarios would benefit the most from browser caching?
